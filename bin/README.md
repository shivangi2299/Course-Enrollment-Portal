# COURSE_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM
The objective of the Project is to develop an Application which is similar to D2L. Major sections of this App are:
1. Login / Sign-up, Events
2. Course Catalog and Enrollment Section
3. Course Detail Page
4. Student Accounts, Discussion 
5. Profile
6. Renting Equipment for Classes
7. Advisors Appointment

All of these Sections are Accessible from a HomePage similar to Campus Connect. The submission document for this app is located [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O24gv_99QWmvtr7fXyRh1UDozIoA5l4M_CWXlHaJSF8/edit)
